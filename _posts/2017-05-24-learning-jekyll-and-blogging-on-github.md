I wanted to start blogging about things that I've been learning and working on, and  I remembered that [GitHub](https://github.com) has GitHub [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) now and wanted to get started with using it. They have a really slick video on their page about it, and make it look like it's really easy to get started using it \(and it is... kinda\). I've had to nuke this entire project once already and start over from scratch due to issues around how I set up my project structure on my desktop, and broke things using git. Hopefully this second time around is all that I will need to get things up and running properly.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full-stack microservice (really basic frontend in Pug/HTML) that takes a FormData object from a file upload form and returns the file size in bytes as part of a JSON response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Url Shortener Microservice</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge here was to create a URL Shortener microservice. It uses a database to associate a short url ID with the original url, and once created, the microservice will redirect visitors of the short URL to the original URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is to create a microservice that will take a date string or a unix timestamp and make a JSON response with both versions of the given timestamp / date.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Gotchas In order of the issue being found:
Is Strange (Hugo) (Template Logic) Hugo templates use strange logic - for conditional statements, Hugo uses Polish or prefix notation for the operators. This meas that instead of writing if this and that, you have to write if and this that. For more complex arrangements of logical conditions, say for a situation in which you need to check three conditions, you have to write it as: if and (first) ( and (second) (third)) which, in a infix notation style, would have been written if first and second and third.</description>

      <description>I woke up late today, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to make coffee. And instead of going to my usual place where I know there&amp;rsquo;s going to be great coffee available, I decided to get a doughnut and some coffee from the doughnut shop. The first warning that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to go well was when I got my travel mug back and there was coffee all over the outside of the mug.</description>

      <description>Built a new site, leaving Jekyll for Hugo, for my github.io page.
Changes Moved all my old Jekyll files to a new subdirectory in order to maintain access to the old code and posts, and then transition all the content over to the main Hugo site as settings come together. One major advantage of Hugo is that the build process is super fast, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at how to integrate CircleCI with Hugo builds.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a lot of progress on the python-LEDSerialController project. There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot to learn about how to run the original command line script with a GUI frontend. I chose to use Tk since it&amp;rsquo;s baked into Python already, and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to configure to get it working. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look nearly as nice as something that would come out of using a more advanced UI toolkit, but it&amp;rsquo;s also had a lower bar to entry, despite some drawbacks with Tk&amp;rsquo;s documentation.</description>

      <description>First Post!
Learning how to set up Jekyll on GitHub Pages is actually a little harder than I was expecting from the outset. Mostly because most of the things that you need to set up Jekyll for local development, and a lot of the things that come prepackaged with it aren&amp;rsquo;t actually necessary for running it on GitHub Pages.
Here is the Gemfile content for this page when I first started and got things working:</description>

      <title>Dust Collector - UW</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have a hammer drill that has a vacuum collector attachment, and we wanted a collector that could use different kinds of filters. I took the existing dust collector and designed an exact replacement that would take any kind of 3M respirator filter as the filter element. This allows using different kinds of filters and for the filters to be replaced. The parts involved were manually reverse-engineered on paper with the device and a set of good digital calipers. The replacement parts were designed in Autodesk &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview&#34;&gt;Fusion360&lt;/a&gt; and 3D printed on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.prusa3d.com/&#34;&gt;Prusa&lt;/a&gt; i3 MK2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>My name is Chase Sawyer. I&amp;rsquo;m an aspiring software maker working at the University of Washington in Seattle. I got my BFA from the UW back in 2013, making robots that make drawings. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve built websites and learned the intricacies of HD AV installation, maintenance, and design. I&amp;rsquo;ve been part of teams that have redesigned and defined the metrics and reporting systems for UW-IT, and have been working with my colleagues at Classroom Technologies &amp;amp; Events to modernize our classroom AV systems.</description>

## Welcome

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. See [this][0] post on transitioning to a custom domain with GitHub Pages.

Below are my most recent posts. Please explore some of the one-off posts, as well as some longer running series that I've started recently (updates as I have time). Check out the projects section for interesting work I've been creating (Completed series will be collected here as well).

Also check out my work on GitHub!

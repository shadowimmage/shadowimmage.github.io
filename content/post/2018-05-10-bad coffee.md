I woke up late today, so I didn't have time to make coffee. And instead of going to my usual place where I know there's going to be great coffee available, I decided to get a doughnut and some coffee from the doughnut shop. The first warning that this wasn't going to go well was when I got my travel mug back and there was coffee all over the outside of the mug. All day since then I've been drinking it slowly (8 hours) and it's just been terrible. It's really made me sad, because I paid money for this coffee, and this is Seattle. I could have gone to the Starbucks down the block from this doughnut shop, but instead decided not to in favor of making one stop, rather than two on my way into work.

I should have just waited longer and gone to my usual place.

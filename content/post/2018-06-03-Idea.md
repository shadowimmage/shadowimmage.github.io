#Insta-Vault

Missing out on Instagram? What happens if instagram (or facebook, or whatever) goes away? Who owns the photos and where do they go?

What if there was a tool that automatically scraped and archived all your friends' posts and tagged them, too? Organized by who posted, when, maybe even use the tags in the description to create an archive that's easily searchable.

Uploads / stores online or to a personal vault/server.

(could this run on the cloud in a serverless environment? Even in a traditional environment?)

#### Tech

- Python
    - Beautiful Soup
- Server/less
    - AWS Lambda
    - S3
- Local
    - Ubuntu Server
    - Chron job to schedule

#### Legality

Instagram probably has rules against this. Dev API definitely doesn't seem to support such things (from a cursory glance) -- also mentioned in their policy that all images are the property of the people who took them (in their view), so would this be stealing?

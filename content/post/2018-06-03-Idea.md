#Insta-Vault

Missing out on Instagram? What happens if instagram (or facebook, or whatever) goes away? Who owns the photos and where do they go?

What if there was a tool that automatically scraped and archived all your friends' posts and tagged them, too? Organized by who posted, when, maybe even use the tags in the description to create an archive that's easily searchable.

Uploads / stores online or to a personal vault/server.

(could this run on the cloud in a serverless environment? Even in a traditional environment?)

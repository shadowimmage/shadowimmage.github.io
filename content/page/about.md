## Summary

I'm a person living in Seattle, Washington where I work for Classroom Technology & Events (CTE) at the University of Washington.

My interests are manifold, from art to computer science. I've built my skillset from a position of curiosity, using an analytical approach to problems and their possible solutions, always researching what I don't know. I love to learn. I solve difficult problems by combining my learning and experience into novel approaches and solutions.

My name is Chase Sawyer. I'm an aspiring software maker working at the University of Washington in Seattle. I got my BFA from the UW back in 2013, making robots that make drawings. Since then I've built websites and learned the intricacies of HD AV installation, maintenance, and design. I've been part of teams that have redesigned and defined the metrics and reporting systems for UW-IT, and have been working with my colleagues at Classroom Technologies &amp; Events to modernize our classroom AV systems.

I've been working at the University of Washington since 2009. Over that period I've had the following positions/titles:

- Event Assistant
- Lead Help Desk Analyst
- Program Support Supervisor I
- Senior Computer Specialist (current)

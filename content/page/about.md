## Summary

I'm a software engineer living in Seattle, Washington, currently working for Classroom Technology & Events (CTE) at the University of Washington.

My interests are manifold, from art to computer science. I've built my skill set from a position of curiosity, using an analytical approach to problems and their possible solutions, always researching what I don't know. I love to learn. I solve difficult problems by combining my learning and experience into novel approaches and solutions.

I'm really interested in security, privacy, and ensuring that data is protected. Encryption is fascinating and I think that it should be accessible and usable by everyone to protect themselves and their data. I also love diving into data and using it to build automation and business intelligence tools.

<!-- scraps and other junk

Development of both commercial and open source software applications and database systems that generate complex metrics and reports used by CTE and UW-IT management and other high level staff throughout the organization.

Manage and maintain 500+ desktop and laptop computers used in classrooms and by departmental staff. Provide technical evaluation, installation, maintenance and support of integrated classroom technology systems and related components. Provide Tier 2 support and perform configuration, diagnostic, repair, and testing functions.

I am using technologies, such as KNIME Analytics Platform and Tableau Desktop/Server, to mine, clean, process, visualize and report on data from ServiceNow, SQL Server, web services, and other sources. I develop software for desktops and open platforms in Java and Python, manage databases within desktop and reporting applications.

Recent projects involve providing real-time and historical data analysis and reporting on institutional performance metrics within Service-Now, developing an open source RFID-based access control solution for classroom equipment using CAD to design 3D printed parts and open source hardware for integrated systems, and managing marketing/communications campaigns to campus stakeholders and customers.

doing HD AV installation, maintenance, and support; I also design and implement business intelligence systems, working with teammates to define and measure performance for UW-IT, CTE, and others. Finally, I design and implement systems and processes that automate or improve workflows for members of CTE. I graduated from the UW back in 2013, designing and building robots that make drawings using open source hardware and software. 

I've been working at the University of Washington since 2009 as a(n):

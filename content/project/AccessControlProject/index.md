We built a system that uses UW members' HuskyCards (campus ID card) to allow them to unlock classroom control systems and equipment drawers in classroom podia. The technology uses RFID to read tags built into the HuskyCard and uses that to look up the user in the university's database, and pull that user's group memberships to determine whether or not they are allowed to access the classroom equipment. As each user is separately identifiable via HuskyCard, the control system can remember users' last used settings and, upon tapping their HuskyCard again later, will recall those settings for their convenience. For example, if an instructor uses a laptop every day, then upon tapping their HuskyCard on the classroom's podium, the control system will turn on the projector and route the laptop input to the projector.

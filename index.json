[{"categories":null,"contents":" This week I had an interesting discussion with another new developer who was getting started working on an Express-based project and was frustrated by their static files working one day, and seemingly without provocation, not working the next. I knew from experiencing the same feeling when dealing with static files both in Django and Express that a static file loading problem is difficult to resolve, and how often the problem is often a simple one that is nonetheless opaque to a new developer unfamiliar with file systems and path resolution.\nWhen static file loaders can\u0026rsquo;t or don\u0026rsquo;t load something, it\u0026rsquo;s often not called out as an error because when you tell the computer where the static files are, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any assumptions about the contents there. And later on when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to load your custom CSS or images and getting nothing loaded, and quiet browser 404 errors for the resource, but not the page overall, the result can be a maddening series of digging into documentation that doesn\u0026rsquo;t often make clear the particulars of path names and how a single dot or slash can make all the difference in the world between success and failure.\nFile Paths A path to a file on a computer, and to an extent, a path to a resource on the internet looks like this: /rootDirectory/subDirectory/file with the file part usually having some kind of type after a dot, such as .txt or .exe. For Windows users, the beginning will have a drive letter at the beginning, most commonly C: C:\\rootDirectory\\subDirectory\\file.\nWhat happened to me, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure has happened to others - such as the individual I was talking to this week - is that nothing in the documentation about static paths goes deeply into path resolution. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s just kind of assumed that you as the developer in control of things should know what\u0026rsquo;s happening in the background, but many do not.\nPath Resolution When you give Express.js (Node) a path to load, it\u0026rsquo;s generally going to be in a relative format. The documentation gives the most basic setup as something like app.use(express.static('public')). The mechanics behind this statement are a bit more complicated than it might seem at first glance.\nWhen you give Node a path such as 'public', a function goes through and makes a best guess as to where you mean to point it. Why doesn\u0026rsquo;t it just know that you mean the folder called \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; (or \u0026lsquo;static\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;img\u0026rsquo; or whatever)? Because Node needs the absolute path on the file system to that directory, and thus the files and folders inside. And this function is pretty lenient about what it will accept in terms of file paths, and will assume that you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nSo, what is the difference between 'public', '/public', and './public'?\nThe first and the last actually resolve to the same destination: relative to the current working directory, find a directory called \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; and serve the contents as static files. However, the second example resolves to something else entirely: find a directory called \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; at the root of the file system. Or more explicitly: instead of resolving to /rootDirectory/subDirectory/project/public/ it will resolve to /public/. Or in Windows, C:\\public\\\nWhen path.js (in Node) runs through resolve() for a given path name, there\u0026rsquo;s this comment in the function:\n/* Lines 201 - 206 of path.js */ if (code === 47/*/*/ || code === 92/*\\*/) { // Possible UNC root  // If we started with a separator, we know we at least have an  // absolute path of some kind (UNC or otherwise)  isAbsolute = true;  Which if you walk through debugger with the above three options, it becomes clear that the middle option '/public' will resolve to an absolute path, rather than a relative path to the current directory where you\u0026rsquo;re working, and that will make all the difference in the world.\nNow, if you do want to give an absolute path from the root of the drive you\u0026rsquo;re working on, then you have a way of doing that by starting the path off with a \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; - otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use relative paths with either a \u0026lsquo;./\u0026rsquo; or just the folder/file you\u0026rsquo;re looking for without anything else.\nI hope that this helps someone out there understand file paths and relieves some frustration around what app.use(express.static('public')) actually means.\n","permalink":"https://shadowimmage.github.io/post/2018-06-09-paths_in_node/","tags":["post","blog","express","javascript","node","filesystem","debugging"],"title":"File Paths in Node"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This project involved setting up a couple MongoDB collections and then building a responsive frontend for user interaction.

Code editors on the other hand are amazingly good for writing - the writing where the only thing that actually matters is the content, and not the format.\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s probably been hashed out and written about a lot by other people, the one thing, the killer aspect of it for me, is the ability to scroll the page down, so that whenever you want, you can always return to that feeling of having a blank canvas to write upon. I really love the blank page, and I love writing on something fresh, and so far, code editors are the only things that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen do this. The word processors - think Google Docs, Microsoft Word, etc. - all stop you at the bottom of the current virtual piece of paper you\u0026rsquo;re writing on and won\u0026rsquo;t let you progress until you flow over onto the next page. Now, of course there\u0026rsquo;s hacks around this, including just inserting a page break or two at the end of whatever it is you\u0026rsquo;re working on. However, this has always felt really artificial to me. Plus there\u0026rsquo;s always those page breaks and virtual pieces of paper that physically break apart your writing. It can be distracting.\nBut to be fair to word processors, I don\u0026rsquo;t think anyone writes their blog posts in them, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think that anyone writes their papers that are meant to be printed in a blog editor.

I feel like I have a pretty solid grasp now on how to build and arrange an API, which I hope will help me in the future when I try to do more API work.\nOver the time that I\u0026rsquo;ve spent on getting this certificate I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot of extra things on top of just how to build an API or microservice, which is also part of the reason that it took so long to get here. From the beginning of the projects on Free Code Camp, I decided that I wanted to wrap everything up together into a cohesive portfolio - something that I could showcase and present to the world that had everything packaged and ready to consume. It also added a whole layer of complexity on top of the challenges that required more research and more work, putting separate parts together into a single application and then designing and building the architecture of the portfolio where it\u0026rsquo;d be showcased. This actually led to two separate projects, the presentation site (this) where I could write up details in longer form and document my work over time, and the project site where all the projects and samples would live together in one application that could be expanded upon as I completed more challenges and coding solutions. I think this played to each platform\u0026rsquo;s strengths as well, since Github Pages is great for static sites and is always online, and Heroku projects can be almost anything you want them to be and won\u0026rsquo;t cost any money (at least for the free tier) - with the only downside being that the first visit to a sleeping \u0026lsquo;Dyno\u0026rsquo; is delayed by a few seconds as the server instance spins up.\nIn the end what really slowed me down in getting this certificate wasn\u0026rsquo;t the actual challenges - each one really only took a few hours of work. It was the external factors, life factors, that made the difference and introduced the largest delays and distance from the work. Things like buying a house, renovating and moving into said house, the relentless autumn + winter holiday madness, and changes in demands at work and at home. Suddenly a year passes, your kid is older, you\u0026rsquo;re older, and you\u0026rsquo;ve neglected your repos for so long that you don\u0026rsquo;t remember why you made this branch or what wasn\u0026rsquo;t working or done last time you committed your code.\nNot having time to dedicate to the work has made it harder to progress than I thought when I first started out. And I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that now that I have momentum and am starting to tell people about the things that I\u0026rsquo;m putting out there (rather than just working in obscurity) that I can maintain that energy and continue to get things done, become more confident, and make some cooler and bigger things.\n","permalink":"https://shadowimmage.github.io/post/2018-06-05-new_free_code_camp_cert/","tags":["post","blog","update","certificate"],"title":"New Free Code Camp Cert"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Repair Task Tracker RTT is a full stack app that addresses the needs of a computer hardware management process, allowing the tracking and resolution of issues/problems with the hardware, as well as the configuration and components of each major hardware item.

I knew that it had to be something that was unique, so I went online looking around for resources on designing and producing a logo. I know that SVGs are great, because you will never have scaling issues - if you need a larger version, you can simply export it at higher resolution. Or lower. Or whatever. I found some sites for inspiration as well, since I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of exactly what I was going for initially.\nThe new design: logobook.com has been really helpful in looking at what kinds of designs you can do with different features or lettering and Logo Design Love was really helpful in getting my head into a good space for designing a logo. Other than that, the first few iterations of designs were just pen-and-paper drawings in my notebook.\nTools Designing a vector graphic is relatively easy if you have a vector graphic editing program. I have known about Inkscape for a while, and this is what I ultimately used. Another tool I found while looking around for vector graphic tools is a browser-based (or downloadable) tool called Vectr. I didn\u0026rsquo;t use Vectr much, but it looks useful if you need really simple tools and don\u0026rsquo;t want to get something as heavyweight as Inkscape. That being said, using Inkscape and it\u0026rsquo;s exceptional grid and guide snapping tools really made designing this logo easy.\nGetting it online In order to fully implement use of the logo, there\u0026rsquo;s several modifications that I had to make, including converting the .svg file to an .ico or .png format that would be browser friendly. Modern browsers support .svg files for page graphics, but most still don\u0026rsquo;t support the format in the favicon space. Only Internet Explorer requires the format be a .ico for the favicon, and most support .png, but in different levels of quality, depending on the browser and age, and if it\u0026rsquo;s a mobile or a desktop browser (not to mention things like consoles with browsers baked in).

This meas that instead of writing if this and that, you have to write if and this that. For more complex arrangements of logical conditions, say for a situation in which you need to check three conditions, you have to write it as: if and (first) ( and (second) (third)) which, in a infix notation style, would have been written if first and second and third.\nHugo uses blackfriday Hugo uses blackfriday as it\u0026rsquo;s markdown engine. This is probably totally fine for most situations, except for when you want to make a list with more than 2 levels. For instance,\n first  second  third    In the above case, blackfriday normally will collapse the second and third levels both into the second level. I say normally because most linters and stye guides specify an indent of 2 spaces for markdown [citation needed]. If you come from github markdown style, then this is likely the case for you. Unfortunately there\u0026rsquo;s an annoying bug in blackfriday that requires that the indent for each level be 4 spaces. If you don\u0026rsquo;t notice this when scanning through the Hugo documentation on content formats, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely run into a situation where you\u0026rsquo;re confused about your list ending up somewhat flattened.\nFortunately, most linters can be configured to have different indent settings. For Visual Studio Code (my current editor of choice), markdownlint can be configured with a .markdownlint.json file in the root of your project directory or in your .vscode\\settings.json workspace settings file. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a show stopper, but for me, wasted some time while I had to dig through to find the issue report in blackfriday and then more time to read the markdownlint documentation and figure out how to reconfigure the indent setting to make sure that my lists in my Hugo site markdown will pass.\nQuestion for later:\nCan I catch this / use markdownlint in CircleCI builds?\nHugo Supports Emoji in Markdown This wasn\u0026rsquo;t super hard to figure out, but could be easier to find info on (I actually think that the Hugo documentation could use a way better table of contents, and better search). I nearly added an emoji css library to my site head in order to support emoji via \u0026lt;i\u0026gt; tags inline in the markdown file, but fortunately found that emoji are natively supported by Hugo, but you have to enable it with the enableEmoji = true setting in the site\u0026rsquo;s root configuration. Once you enable emoji support for content files with that setting, you can easily insert emoji with their names between colons (eg 😩).\nProtip: want larger emoji on your page? Have a header with an emoji rather than plain text. The emoji will scale to the predefined scale of the header.

I had already branched my project to start working with Hugo to the hugo branch, with the intent that this branch would eventually merge back with master.

The hugo branch will remain indefinitely as the new default branch on the site repository.\nOn the other hand, this will work out fine, as it will let me ser CircleCI up to pull the current hugo branch when updated, and then upon successful build, will be able to push the resulting build back up to the repository\u0026rsquo;s master branch.

Part of that process involved moving the scheduling database off-site. This allowed for a new integration to our Slack instance that could contact the R25 web service, now hosted on the CollegeNET servers, rather than secured locally on one of the UW\u0026rsquo;s servers.\nTimeline I came up with the idea for this project around April 18th, 2018, after talking to some colleagues about transitioning other internal tools that leveraged the local SQL database over to the R25 web service after the system transitioned to the cloud. Our department had recently been granted access to the web service, and I had spent the earlier part of the month translating Python scripts that had been digesting local SQL results to talking to the R25 web service and digesting XML instead. I spent about a week researching the possible integrations between Slack and external apps, and decided to use a Slack Slash Command for the integration\u0026rsquo;s implementation. The first version of the app was released on May 4th.\nImplementation Full details on the README\nTo quickly get up and running I started out with AWS Lambda and getting up to speed with what was necessary to get an AWS Lambda function working on the web. This led me to Serverless as a way of accelerating development and management of AWS resources.\nThe first version of the integration used only one Lambda function, but in order to echo commands back to the user in a channel and also respond later asynchronously, two Lambda functions are required. This is because each Lambda function can only reply to the request / trigger that started it once. If the Lambda function replies to Slack to acknowledge receipt of the command, then it won\u0026rsquo;t be able to reply later once the R25 data has been retrieved and processed. If the Lambda function waits until it\u0026rsquo;s gathered and processed all the R25 data, then it might miss the 3-second window to acknowledge the Slack command, and even if it does reply within the time frame, the confirmation of the command happens after the results are returned to Slack, making the confirmation show up not only late, but out of order. Thus two Lambda functions are required: one to parse and return acknowledge the command and another to query and process the R25 web service data.\nScreenshots Invoking   Invocation\n    Help   Help\n    ","permalink":"https://shadowimmage.github.io/project/slackr25bot/","tags":["project","aws","lambda","sns","slack","UW"],"title":"SlackR25Bot - UW"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been making a lot of progress on the python-LEDSerialController project. There\u0026rsquo;s been a lot to learn about how to run the original command line script with a GUI frontend. I chose to use Tk since it\u0026rsquo;s baked into Python already, and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to configure to get it working. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t look nearly as nice as something that would come out of using a more advanced UI toolkit, but it\u0026rsquo;s also had a lower bar to entry, despite some drawbacks with Tk\u0026rsquo;s documentation. Googling around for solutions to problems as they arise has proved to be effective though.\nGetting this project to run smoothly has been a challenge because I\u0026rsquo;m using one thread to accomplish everything, which comes with the restriction that nothing can be blocking (at least not for long) without causing UI lag (bad) or causing responsiveness on the LED controller (Arduino) to lag. This is further complicated by the way that I\u0026rsquo;ve built up the Arduino code to allow it to perform animations with the LED strips and check in on the serial buffer.\nAll of this combines to create the following conditions:\n The Arduino only checks in with the computer when it\u0026rsquo;s ready for a new command in between running pattern animations, which depends on the interval setting for the last command that was sent The UI only updates while the Python thread is not blocked or doing anything long-running Updating the Arduino requires checking the computer\u0026rsquo;s serial buffer to see if the Arduino has signaled that it\u0026rsquo;s ready for the next command.  Disadvantages of doing things this way:\n A pattern animation, such as the animated rainbow, will only run for a single cycle, and then stop. More to the point, without any serial input from the host computer, the Arduino will cease to update any LEDs at all. The host computer must continually update the Arduino (controller) with what to do next, including, telling it to do the same thing over again.  Advantages of doing things this way:\n Any updates to state on the Python host program can update the controller with new information as soon as it\u0026rsquo;s ready UI to Controller update delay is minimal UI can remain responsive while the controller is busy and not ready for communication  Timing on the Tk application can be tricky in this situation: checking the serial input as often as possible can push CPU usage to 100%, and accomplishes nothing productive since the Arduino won\u0026rsquo;t be ready for updates that frequently. On the other hand, checking too infrequently will lead to stuttering in continuous patterns, but will leave more time on the host PC for keeping the UI responsive.\nThe way I solved this was to ensure that any blocking actions are only executed when absolutely necessary. In this instance, I can use the pyserial in_waiting property to know when the Arduino has sent data that needs to be checked:\ndef serial_has_waiting(self): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Return true if there is serial data in the input buffer - non-Blocking\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return self.cmdMessenger.comm.in_waiting != 0 Using that method allows me to avoid going into my incoming data handling code before there\u0026rsquo;s anything in the input buffer to read:\ndef getCommandSet(self, src): receivedCmdSet = None logging.debug(src + \u0026#39;: getCommand...\u0026#39;) while (self.cmdMessenger.comm.in_waiting == 0): # blocking - here as a final check before self.c.receive() time.sleep(0.1) receivedCmdSet = self.c.receive() logging.debug(src + \u0026#39;: getCommand complete.\u0026#39;) if (receivedCmdSet[0] == \u0026#34;CMDERROR\u0026#34;): logging.error(\u0026#34;CMDERROR: \u0026#34; + receivedCmdSet[1][0]) logging.debug(receivedCmdSet) return receivedCmdSet The final piece is making a method that will be called for every cycle of the Tk mainloop() - first in main:\nif __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: try: if setup(): pre_run_commands() app.after(500, update_controller) # HERE app.mainloop() except KeyboardInterrupt: # Called when user ends process with CTRL+C stop() And within update_controller():\ndef update_controller(): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Check the LED Controller, and issue, or re-issue a command as needed\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; if LEDController.serial_has_waiting(): LEDController.repeat() app.after(75, update_controller) # HERE The important part here is the amount of time (in milliseconds) that the app.after() is given for the next check. Initially from main, I have it set at 500ms, since we want to get things going and allow a little time for the UI to get started before we start the serial communication with the Arduino in earnest. Later on, it\u0026rsquo;s reduced to 75ms in update_controller() so that we can have enough time to update the UI, not overburden the CPU, and also be sure to catch input from the Arduino relatively quickly (within about 75ms, which is pretty fast). This balance is fast enough that animations on the Arduino don\u0026rsquo;t perceptibly have a delay in between iterations.\nI might tune these values more, but for now things seem to be running well enough that I can focus on further development of the UI and implementing more advanced actions through the Tk GUI, and eventually (long term) start building out connections to other applications and APIs that would allow the LED strip to react to events from other applications or web services.\n","permalink":"https://shadowimmage.github.io/post/2017-06-21-python-tk-iu-notes-project-update/","tags":["python","gui","update"],"title":"Python Tk UI Notes, Project Update"},{"categories":null,"contents":"First Post!\nLearning how to set up Jekyll on GitHub Pages is actually a little harder than I was expecting from the outset. Mostly because most of the things that you need to set up Jekyll for local development, and a lot of the things that come prepackaged with it aren\u0026rsquo;t actually necessary for running it on GitHub Pages.\nHere is the Gemfile content for this page when I first started and got things working:\nsource \u0026#34;https://rubygems.org\u0026#34; ruby RUBY_VERSION # ... gem \u0026#34;jekyll\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;~\u0026gt; 3.3\u0026#34; gem \u0026#34;jekyll-theme-slate\u0026#34; # If you have any plugins, put them here! group :jekyll_plugins do gem \u0026#34;jekyll-feed\u0026#34; gem \u0026#34;github-pages\u0026#34; end This is actually a mix of what you end up with when you create a site from scratch on GitHub Pages using the theme chooser with an empty repository. And it\u0026rsquo;s also different from the one you\u0026rsquo;d get by starting locally using the Jekyll Quick-start guide. While the Quick-start mentions this helpful guide to getting started using Jekyll on GitHub Pages (which I worked through and found to bve educational in getting things set up), it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make use of the nice (an easy to use) templates / themes that you can select through the GitHub Pages repository settings. To do that, you need to use the template HTML / CSS from the theme baked into GitHub Pages by copying default.html according to this article on GitHub Help.\nOnce you have your theme working, and you have a working website that you can reach, and your content is showing up the way you expect, you can begin customizing and adding in plugins, custom CSS, etc.\nOne final issue I ran into was a dependency issue with the Gemfile.lock vs. the Gemfile when trying to set up this site to use CircleCI (more for fun getting to know CircleCI than anything else). The issue was that when I created a local Jekyll deployment for testing with the same repository as the one I was using for GitHub Pages, I had been making a lot of ignorant changes to my Gemfile. There were conflicting entries between the two and my resolution (since there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much here to break yet) was to rename Gemfile.lock to Gemfile.lock.old left my Gemfile as it was, and then reran bundle install, which will regenerate Gemfile.lock, without any conflicts between them.\nOnce that was ironed out, CircleCI was able to complete without errors, but without a circle.yml, it also didn\u0026rsquo;t have any tests to run in order to say anything about the state of the project. So I put together a basic configuration:\nmachine:ruby:version:2.4.0dependencies:post:-bundleexecjekyllbuildtest:post:-bundleexechtmlproofer./_site--check-html--disable-external The above is basically lifted from the CircleCI page in the Jekyll docs, plus specifying the ruby version that\u0026rsquo;s currently being used by GitHub Pages.\nAnother issue that I ran into trying to get this page to build on CircleCI was this Jekyll issue (#2938). So I had to add \u0026ldquo;vendor\u0026rdquo; to the exclude list - this was not immediately clear (since I hardly know YAML at all) because it\u0026rsquo;s listed on the fixes as \u0026gt; yml \u0026gt; exclude: [vendor] \u0026gt; But if you want it in a YAML list, it needs to be noted as\nexclude:-vendor-....otherexcludes.... So after all that, do I have a passing build? No.\nhtmlproofer found some \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;#\u0026quot;\u0026gt; placeholder tags and failed.\nBut at least now it\u0026rsquo;s failing because of something I wrote, rather than because of a configuration issue!\nSuccess and progress.\n","permalink":"https://shadowimmage.github.io/post/2017-05-25-learning-jekyll-and-getting-started-with-github-pages/","tags":["jekyll","update","learning"],"title":"Learning Jekyll and Getting Started with Github Pages"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We have a hammer drill that has a vacuum collector attachment, and we wanted a collector that could use different kinds of filters. I took the existing dust collector and designed an exact replacement that would take any kind of 3M respirator filter as the filter element. This allows using different kinds of filters and for the filters to be replaced. The parts involved were manually reverse-engineered on paper with the device and a set of good digital calipers. The replacement parts were designed in Autodesk Fusion360 and 3D printed on a Prusa i3 MK2.\n\nReverse Engineering a Device Digital calipers are infinitely helpful when trying to reverse engineer or copy a physical object with 3D CAD and 3D Printing. Dimension all the parts on a drawing and then use those measurements to create the 3D model in CAD. This was a challenging project, and one of the most complex models that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had to engineer. The result was a device that was a perfect 1:1 fit in the overall vacuum body.\nChallenges The original filter device didn\u0026rsquo;t need to have any moving parts, and the filter was build into the wall between the chamber and the outlet. For my design I had to get a round filter to attach to a rectangular shaft, and also position the connection point somewhere where the filter could be folded around into the rectangular space of the dust chamber. Using a lofted profile allowed me to blend the rectangular outlet port into a circular tube to connect with the filter body. This worked well and maintained equal or greater volume between the filter connection point and the outlet port (no pinch point for the airflow).\nThe other challenge was designing a sliding joint that would hopefully be tight enough to seal, keeping the dust contained within the chamber and maintaining vacuum pressure. It took several test prints with small cut-away sections of the sliding joint between the two halves to get the tolerances just right to be tight without being loose or impossible to slide. This was definitely helped by making sure that the 3D printer was well calibrated and consistent throughout the entire print.\nDrawings   Reference measurements taken from the original device\n      Reference measurements taken from a sample filter scan\n     Results Below is a rendering of the 3D model from Fusion360.

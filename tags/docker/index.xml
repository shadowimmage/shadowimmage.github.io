      <description>Fair warning: This is a work in progress, and I&amp;rsquo;m still working out the details for this project.
Github Repository
I have started to work on getting a digital signage solution set up where I can set up a Raspberry Pi3 to display information on a screen, and that has no local interaction (no UI, running headless without any keyboard/mouse). I wanted a solution to control updates to the app, which is where BalenaCloud comes in (along with their handy OS for the Raspberry Pi).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m building a web infrastructure project that&amp;rsquo;s based around the project verbose-equals-true (referred to as VET from now on), which sets out to create a set of services to support modern web apps, using several Docker based images to collect everything into separate concerns. I like the philosophy behind the project, and it looks well thought out, however, as things are always changing in this landscape and nobody has the same development environment, there&amp;rsquo;s always going to be stumbling blocks.</description>

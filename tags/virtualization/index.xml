      <description>I had to set up an Ubuntu VM (Virtual Machine) on my machine recently and because I also use Docker, I had to learn exactly how Hyper-V handles networking tasks between the host machine and the virtual machines you set up. Hyper-V, as far as I understand, has 3 main networking methods called virtual switches. There&amp;rsquo;s actually a 4th option that comes out of the box, which is something of a hybrid between an &amp;ldquo;Internal Switch&amp;rdquo; and an &amp;ldquo;External Switch&amp;rdquo;.</description>

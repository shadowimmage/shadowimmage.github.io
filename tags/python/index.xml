      <description>Repair Task Tracker RTT is a full stack app that addresses the needs of a computer hardware management process, allowing the tracking and resolution of issues/problems with the hardware, as well as the configuration and components of each major hardware item. RTT is meant to be a back-of-house tool, replacing paper tickets and spreadsheets. The goal of this project was to implement a GraphQL app, with useful data, allowing a seamless user experience as they operate through the app, and data is downloaded and uploaded in the background.</description>

      <description>The Keys App was my first major project that sought to solve a problem with managing key checkouts without requiring a cumbersome customer database / sign up form. This would target an institution that mostly catered to internal customers, such as a university&amp;rsquo;s AV department and it&amp;rsquo;s instructors. It largely replicates a paper-form-based system, with an added layer of data validation and control (emails, phone numbers must be in a valid format; keys can only be returned by their original owners; keys can&amp;rsquo;t be checked out twice; etc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been making a lot of progress on the python-LEDSerialController project. There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot to learn about how to run the original command line script with a GUI frontend. I chose to use Tk since it&amp;rsquo;s baked into Python already, and there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to configure to get it working. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look nearly as nice as something that would come out of using a more advanced UI toolkit, but it&amp;rsquo;s also had a lower bar to entry, despite some drawbacks with Tk&amp;rsquo;s documentation.</description>

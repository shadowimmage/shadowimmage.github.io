      <description>New app in progress! Hopefully it won&#39;t take months to complete. Should be pretty simple. Especially since this app is going to be primarily for me - and I&#39;m not going to worry too too much about the UI elements. Thinking this is going to be primarily a django based app with templates and model-based views like the keys app.
Current State: Developing database models
Purpose Provide myself and whoever wants it a place to track their car maintenance, and to make sure that they know when the next scheduled service for a particular maintenance item is due.</description>

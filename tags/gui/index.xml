      <description>I&#39;ve been making a lot of progress on the python-LEDSerialController project. There&#39;s been a lot to learn about how to run the original command line script with a GUI frontend. I chose to use Tk since it&#39;s baked into Python already, and there&#39;s nothing to configure to get it working. It doesn&#39;t look nearly as nice as something that would come out of using a more advanced UI toolkit, but it&#39;s also had a lower bar to entry, despite some drawbacks with Tk&#39;s documentation.</description>

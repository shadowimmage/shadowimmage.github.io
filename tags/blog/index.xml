      <description>This week I had an interesting discussion with another new developer who was getting started working on an Express-based project and was frustrated by their static files working one day, and seemingly without provocation, not working the next. I knew from experiencing the same feeling when dealing with static files both in Django and Express that a static file loading problem is difficult to resolve, and how often the problem is often a simple one that is nonetheless opaque to a new developer unfamiliar with file systems and path resolution.</description>

      <title>Code Editors vs. Word Processors</title>

      <description>Word processors are great for creating documents with a lot of rich formatting, but all that stuff can be a huge distraction. Code editors on the other hand are amazingly good for writing - the writing where the only thing that actually matters is the content, and not the format.
While it&amp;rsquo;s probably been hashed out and written about a lot by other people, the one thing, the killer aspect of it for me, is the ability to scroll the page down, so that whenever you want, you can always return to that feeling of having a blank canvas to write upon.</description>

      <description>I got my back-end (now API and Microservice) cert today from Free Code Camp! https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/shadowimmage/apis-and-microservices Hooray!
It&amp;rsquo;s been a year since I started working through the Free Code Camp curriculum, and it feels good to finally have finished the API work. I feel like I have a pretty solid grasp now on how to build and arrange an API, which I hope will help me in the future when I try to do more API work.</description>

      <description>I woke up late today, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to make coffee. And instead of going to my usual place where I know there&amp;rsquo;s going to be great coffee available, I decided to get a doughnut and some coffee from the doughnut shop. The first warning that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to go well was when I got my travel mug back and there was coffee all over the outside of the mug.</description>

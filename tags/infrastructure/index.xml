      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m building a web infrastructure project that&amp;rsquo;s based around the project verbose-equals-true (referred to as VET from now on), which sets out to create a set of services to support modern web apps, using several Docker based images to collect everything into separate concerns. I like the philosophy behind the project, and it looks well thought out, however, as things are always changing in this landscape and nobody has the same development environment, there&amp;rsquo;s always going to be stumbling blocks.</description>

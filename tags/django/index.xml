      <description>New app in progress! Hopefully it won&amp;rsquo;t take months to complete. Should be pretty simple. Especially since this app is going to be primarily for me - and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to worry too too much about the UI elements. Thinking this is going to be primarily a django based app with templates and model-based views like the keys app.
Current State: Developing database models
Purpose Provide myself and whoever wants it a place to track their car maintenance, and to make sure that they know when the next scheduled service for a particular maintenance item is due.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m building a web infrastructure project that&amp;rsquo;s based around the project verbose-equals-true (referred to as VET from now on), which sets out to create a set of services to support modern web apps, using several Docker based images to collect everything into separate concerns. I like the philosophy behind the project, and it looks well thought out, however, as things are always changing in this landscape and nobody has the same development environment, there&amp;rsquo;s always going to be stumbling blocks.</description>

      <description>I have been working on the backend for a project that I&amp;rsquo;ve written about {{previously&amp;ndash;link}}. The established tools server that will be supporting my new React frontend app(s) will be using a backend built on Python 2.7 and Django 1.11, and thus I&amp;rsquo;ve had to remember how to get a development environment set up that will appropriately support the project running locally on my machine. I have a personal site that runs on the same version of Django, but with Python 3.</description>

      <title>KeysApp</title>

      <description>The Keys App was my first major project that sought to solve a problem with managing key checkouts without requiring a cumbersome customer database / sign up form. This would target an institution that mostly catered to internal customers, such as a university&amp;rsquo;s AV department and it&amp;rsquo;s instructors. It largely replicates a paper-form-based system, with an added layer of data validation and control (emails, phone numbers must be in a valid format; keys can only be returned by their original owners; keys can&amp;rsquo;t be checked out twice; etc.</description>

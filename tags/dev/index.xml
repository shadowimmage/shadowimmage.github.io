      <description>New app in progress! Hopefully it won&#39;t take months to complete. Should be pretty simple. Especially since this app is going to be primarily for me - and I&#39;m not going to worry too too much about the UI elements. Thinking this is going to be primarily a django based app with templates and model-based views like the keys app.
Current State: Developing database models
Purpose Provide myself and whoever wants it a place to track their car maintenance, and to make sure that they know when the next scheduled service for a particular maintenance item is due.</description>

      <description>At the end of February 2019, Google released general access to the .dev top level domain. I had heard about this happening about a year ago, and am now the happy owner of two .dev domains! One of these is chasesawyer.dev and will soon be the new home of this site!
But how to get it set up? When you buy a domain name, nothing is really set up for them - going to those addresses doesn&#39;t point to anything Firefox and Google will just say &amp;ldquo;Server not found.</description>

      <description>I spent my sick day today designing a new logo for the site using Inkscape. I knew that it had to be something that was unique, so I went online looking around for resources on designing and producing a logo. I know that SVGs are great, because you will never have scaling issues - if you need a larger version, you can simply export it at higher resolution. Or lower.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal is to create a microservice that will take a date string or a unix timestamp and make a JSON response with both versions of the given timestamp / date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Gotchas In order of the issue being found:
Is Strange (Hugo) (Template Logic) Hugo templates use strange logic - for conditional statements, Hugo uses Polish or prefix notation for the operators. This meas that instead of writing if this and that, you have to write if and this that. For more complex arrangements of logical conditions, say for a situation in which you need to check three conditions, you have to write it as: if and (first) ( and (second) (third)) which, in a infix notation style, would have been written if first and second and third.</description>

      <description>Built a new site, leaving Jekyll for Hugo, for my github.io page.
Changes Moved all my old Jekyll files to a new subdirectory in order to maintain access to the old code and posts, and then transition all the content over to the main Hugo site as settings come together. One major advantage of Hugo is that the build process is super fast, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at how to integrate CircleCI with Hugo builds.</description>
